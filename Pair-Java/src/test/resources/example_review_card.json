You know this. To add to the confusion, many companies are now parading out multiple top-drawer phones: think Samsung's Galaxy S and Note series, or the Xperia Z and Z Ultra from Sony. Even LG, whose new G2 flagship I'm poring over this time around, has both the G and G Pro to tempt buyers. It's getting increasingly difficult to launch a smartphone with some standout feature, something <em>more</em> than just <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/09/04/samsung-galaxy-note-3-preview/\">bigger screens</a> and faster processors.</p> <p>For the G2, LG's decided to make a major change to the phone's physical layout -- in a bullet-point summary, it has buttons on the back.",
